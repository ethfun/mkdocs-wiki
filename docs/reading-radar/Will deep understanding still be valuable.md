- I have consistently found that the most valuable thing is to know how things work.
- I am utterly convinced that deep understanding is important
- How to do VS how does it work?


!!! Abstract
    - Knowing how to allocate and free memory is one thing. Much better is to have understanding of how the memory allocator works. That is the kind of depth that gives me what I need to make decisions.
    - Writing SQL statements is fairly easy. But there is a lot going on under the hood. The whole experience goes so much better if I understand indexes and table scans and lock escalation.
    - Most people facing a software problem will move forward as soon as they are unblocked, without stopping to learn why the given solution worked
    - It seems like most people in our industry care far more about "how to do" rather than "how does it work"
