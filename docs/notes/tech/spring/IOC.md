    Frankly, I think the reason for that is that most people actually don't understand what Dependency Injection is, 
    which means that instead of grasping the concept of Inversion of Control, they go looking for a replacement for the new keyword they're already used to. 
    Then they find a DI Container and (mis)use it as a Service Locator. Unfortunately, that's very easy to do.
